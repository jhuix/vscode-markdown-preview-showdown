## Requirements

### For local rendering plantuml
  
When local rendering plantuml requires `Java` support, so [Java environment (JDK or JRE)](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) needs to be installed and the Java executor directory needs to be set to the global path environment variable for the extension to work: 

- JAVA_HOME: Java SDK installed directory (must have a bin sub-directory)
- Windows example: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_101)
- macOS example: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home
- PATH: the global path environment variable
- Windows example: PATH=%PATH%;%JAVA_HOME%\bin
- macOS example: PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin

If you want to use PlantUML's functionality that requires [GraphViz](https://www.graphviz.org/download/), you need to download and install it, and to set the `GRAPHVIZ_DOT` environment variable, as explained here:

- GRAPHVIZ_DOT: Path for the dot executable binary
- Windows example: C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin\dot.exe
- macOS example: /usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/2.38.0_1/bin/dot

After setting these environment variables you need to restart VSCode for the extension to work.
